  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-box">
    <p>
      I’m passionate about <strong>cybersecurity and technology</strong>, with experience 
      building projects through programs like <strong>Girls Who Code</strong>. I’ve worked on 
      projects such as <em>Breach Bot</em> and explored topics like cryptography and Python programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy solving complex problems, analyzing systems for weaknesses, and learning new 
      ways to defend against cyber threats. My skills include <strong>Python basics, 
      cybersecurity fundamentals, and cryptography</strong>, and I’m committed to growing 
      as a professional in this field.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to become a <strong>SOC Analyst</strong>, where I can apply my curiosity, 
      attention to detail, and technical skills to protect organizations from evolving threats. 
      For me, cybersecurity isn’t just a career path — it’s something I’m genuinely excited 
      to pursue and continue learning about.
